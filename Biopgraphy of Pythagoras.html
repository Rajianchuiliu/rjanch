<p>Although Pythagoras was not the best Greek mathematician,he made many contributions to the way we use maths today.Pythagoras travelled to Greece and Egypt and then moved to Croton where he established his school. He made contribution to the field of science and mathematics.Pythhagoras in credited with inventing the Pythyagorean theorem.He also founded the Pythagorean brotherhood.Pythagoras also invented a lot of number patterns.Plato and Aristotle were influenced by Pythagoras's way of thinking.Also,he was a Greek religious leader who made huge developments in math that may have Pythagoras of Samos is often described as the first pure mathematician.He is an extremely important figure in the development of modern mathematics et we know relatively few facts of his life.</p>
<p>Pythagoras was born in about 570 BC in the island of Samos.He died in about 475 BC but his death place is not known.Little is known of Pythagoras's childhood.All accounts of his physical appearance seem to be false except the description of a birthmark which he had on his thigh.Pythagoras's father was a Mnesarchus brought corn to Samos at a time of famine and was granted citizenship of Samos as a mark of gratitute.Pythagoras's mother was Pythais.</p>
<p>
	Pythagoras's account of his mathematical and philosophy career is tentative. Hence, the historians shared doubts about his true contributions to mathematics and philosophy. It is speculated that much of his notable works was actually accomplished by his successors and contemporaries. Pythagoras was the first one to refer himself as a philosopher and his ideas left a profound impact on Plato and helped shape the Western philosophy.

<p>Owing to the fact that there was not much known about Pythagoras, myths were associated with him. It was Neoplatonist writers who came up with details about him. Isocrates and Herodotus believed that Mnesarchus was his father, who was a wealthy merchant and a gem engraver. He migrated to Greek colony of Croton around 530 BC, where he established a school of philosophy which was based on simple way of life as dictated by him. In addition to that, Pythagoras got involved in the Greek political affairs and acquired some influence. Due to political upheaval and unrest with the neighbouring colony of Sybaris most of his disciples flee the colony and he too had to flee prior to the outbreak of civil war. He found shelter in Metapontum where he spend the rest of his life.
