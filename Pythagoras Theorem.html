</head><strong><b>PYTHAGORAS THEOREM</b></strong>
<body>
<p>
	Pythagoras Theorem(also called Pythagorean Theorem) is an important topic in mathematics,which explains the relation between the sides of a right-angled triangle.The sides of the right triangle are also called Pythagorean triples.the formula and proof of this theorem are explained here with examples.	
	</p>
	<p>Pythagoras theorem is basically used to find the length of an unkhown side and the angle of a triangle.By this theorem, we cn derive the base,perpendicular and hypotenuse formulas.Let us now learn the mathematics of the Pythyagorean theorem in detail</p>

<header><b><u>Statement</u></b></header>
<body>
	<p>Pythagoras theorem states that<b>"In a right-angled triangle , the square of he hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides".</b>The sides of this triangle have been named Perpendicular, Base and Hypotenuse.Here,the hypotenuse is the longest side,as it is opposite to the angle 90&#176. The sides of a right triangle (say a,b and c) which have positive integer values, when squared,are put into an equation, also called a Pythagorean triple.</p>

<header><strong><u>Pythagoras Theorem formula</u></strong></header>
<body>
 <p>Let us consider the triangle given above:</p>
 <p>Where "a" is the perpendicular,</p>
 <p>"b" is the base,</p>
 <p>"c" is the hypotenuse.</p>
 <p>According to the definition, the Pythagoras Theorem formula is given as:</p>
 <p><strong>Hypotenuse<sup>2</sup> = Perpendicular<sup>2</sup> + Base<sup>2</sup></strong></p>
 <p><strong>a<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup></strong></p>
 <p>The side opposite to the right angle(90&#176) is the longest side(known as Hypotenuse) because the side oppposite to the greatest angle is the longest.</p>

 <p>Consider the squares of sides a,b,c mounted on the three sides of a triangle having the same sides as shown.</p>
 <p><strong>By Pythagoras Theorem-</strong></p>
 <p>Area of square"a" + Area of square "b" = Area of square "c"</p>
